# IC74-Database

# Notes

- The 74 in the above list can be replaced with 54 to generate the 5400 series. The 5400 series were functionally the same as the 7400 series but with wider operating and storage temperature ranges, better resistance to vibration and mechanical shock, and other abuse. The more robust 5400 series was built to military specifications, commonly known as milspec.

- A few alphabetic characters to designate a specific logic subfamily may immediately follow the 74 or 54 in the part number, e.g., 74LS74 for Low-power Schottky vs. 74HCT74 for High-speed CMOS with TTL-compatible input thresholds. Not all functions are available in all families.

- In a few instances, such as the 7478 and 74107, the same suffix in different families do not have completely equivalent logic functions.


# Spicifications
- 74xx or 74Nxx: Standard TTL – These devices are the original TTL family of logic gates introduced in the early 70’s. They have a propagation delay of about 10ns and a power consumption of about 10mW. Supply voltage range: 4.75 to 5.25 volts

-  74Lxx: Low Power TTL – Power consumption was improved over standard types by increasing the number of internal resistances but at the cost of a reduction in switching speed. Supply voltage range: 4.75 to 5.25 volts

-  74Hxx: High Speed TTL – Switching speed was improved by reducing the number of internal resistances. This also increased the power consumption. Supply voltage range: 4.75 to 5.25 volts

-  74Sxx: Schottky TTL – Schottky technology is used to improve input impedance, switching speed and power consumption (2mW) compared to the 74Lxx and 74Hxx types. Supply voltage range: 4.75 to 5.25 volts

-  74LSxx: Low Power Schottky TTL – Same as 74Sxx types but with increased internal resistances to improve power consumption. Supply voltage range: 4.75 to 5.25 volts

-  74ASxx: Advanced Schottky TTL – Improved design over 74Sxx Schottky types optimised to increase switching speed at the expense of power consumption of about 22mW. Supply voltage range: 4.5 to 5.5 volts

-  74ALSxx: Advanced Low Power Schottky TTL – Lower power consumption of about 1mW and higher switching speed of 4nS compared to 74LSxx types. Supply voltage range: 4.5 to 5.5 volts

-  74HCxx: High Speed CMOS – CMOS technology and transistors to reduce power consumption of less than 1uA with CMOS compatible inputs. Supply voltage range: 4.5 to 5.5 volts

-  74HCTxx: High Speed CMOS – CMOS technology and transistors to reduce power consumption of less than 1uA but has increased propagation delay of about 16nS due to the TTL compatible inputs. Supply voltage range: 4.5 to 5.5 volts
